### Jorg Bernhard ReskeðŸ‘‹

Have just finished Fullstack Javascript with Cubos Academy. Now I'm a product Manager with +8 years of knowledge and 12 years of UX / UI Design and 2 years of Programming.

Just let me say, it dosn't matter the dress code, if the room is elegant or not. Your team has to believe in you, and you must give them the deserved trust and space to do their jobs. Of course, since all projects are time line defined, you have to make presure and keep strength, but only if its going to slow. Lidership is a two sided sword. Think about it....

Management without the use of a established time line is not possible. During any project you will have several number of actions at the same time. How to control and when relocate the working group. The time line is the basis protocol to ceep your management function. Be on time all the time.

As a product manager, my job is to figure out what people need and deliver it to them. To do that successfully, we need to be involved in all aspects of the development process, doing things as diverse as facilitating vision and scope definition to designing user manuals to understanding an engineering requirement and explaining it to a non-technical audience. I help Companies around the globe to find their path to solving user problems while contributing to bussiness goals that matter.
Being a source of truth requires a diverse combination of soft-skills and hardskills, the understanding of the business reason, to be able to create a product, visiond by the development community, receiving user information, envolving UX UI Designer and achieving a scope, with garanty of quality.
Well yes, thats my job.
